__*p.359 #11. Find the area from 0 to 1 between these functions: y=4^x and y=2^x.*__

We can use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus 2 for this:
$$
\int _{ a }^{b }{ (f(x) - g(x))dx}\\
$$
The integrals are $$4^x/ln(4) + C$$ and $$2^x/ln(2) + C$$  0 to 1 is an easy interval to ingrate over since we get $$4/ln(4) - 1/ln(4) = 3/ln(4)$$ and $$2/ln(2) - 1/ln(2) = 1/ln(2)$$.  Here we use R to do the math:

```{r}
int1 <- function(x) {4^x}
q1 <- integrate(int1, lower = 0, upper = 1)
q1
```
```{r}
int2 <- function(x) {2^x}
q2 <- integrate(int2, lower = 0, upper = 1)
q2
```

```{r}
q1$value - q2$value
```

Area is .7213475

And to check:
```{r}

3/log(4)-1/log(2)
```
